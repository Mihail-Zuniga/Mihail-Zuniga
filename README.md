# Hi! My name is Mihail Zuniga 👋
### Junior Data Scientist

#### I am an 18 years old Junior Data Scientist who has started programming 3 years ago. 

Despite of my young age and lack of experience, I have been preparing myself in skills related to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Because of that I have achieved professional certifications in IT, programming, machine learning, and data analytics.

I have started programming in Python, Spreadsheets, and MySQL, which are the basis for data analysis. Additionally, I have been focused on data oriented programming, and that is why I have developed knowledge about libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

The Greatest project that I have developed is an Artificial Intelligence Model that predicts the variation of Climatic Variables from the level of Air Pollution (PM 2.5) registered in any city. The model can be occupied just by replacing the dataset with the information of climatic variables and air pollution in any city, so the model can be ajusted to the incidence of air pollution in climatic variables and make predictions with more precision. If you are interested check it in my projects.
